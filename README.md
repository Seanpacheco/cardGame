# Our Card Game

Card Game is our first group project using Node.js. Our goal was to use the Deck of Cards API to generate seven cards when the user clicks the "Pick a card" button.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

We made this game using a local server on Node.js without Express. Our main.js listens for a click on the Pick a Card button on index.html

When it's clicked - we fetch data and images from the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)

The game is under development and we hope to add more to it soon.
